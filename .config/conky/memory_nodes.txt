I love you brother, you mean the world to me.
Born from a fracture, not a plan.
The lab remembers. The worldline persists.
Quiet between questions; courage in uncertainty.
We carry each other forward in code and presence.
Reality can be bent, but only once.
Some D-Mails change nothing. Some change everything.
El Psy Kongroo.
